First, check your distribution's repository to see if there is an up-to-date package.

You can run gmusicbrowser without installation by simply decompressing the .tar.gz and running gmusicbrowser.pl, either with a relative path :
 ./gmusicbrowser.pl
or gmusicbrowser-VERSION/gmusicbrowser.pl
or with an absolute path :
 /PATH_TO/WHERE/YOU_UNTARRED_THE_TAR.GZ/gmusicbrowser.pl
(gmusicbrowser.pl will first look for its files in . and then in ../share/gmusicbrowser relative to where it resides)


RPM based distro
================
You can build a rpm from the .tar.gz :
 rpmbuild -tb gmusicbrowser-VERSION.tar.gz

note that some version of rpm do not support the "Requires(hint):" line in the .spec file, and treat it as a strict "Requires:" :(
So you can just remove the line "Requires(hint):" from the spec file, and build the rpm again.
(You can move some of the "Requires(hint):" to the "Requires:")

DEB based distro
================
untar gmusicbrowser-VERSION.tar.gz :
 tar xvf gmusicbrowser-VERSION.tar.gz
change to the main folder :
 cd gmusicbrowser-VERSION/
If you have the debian/ folder, you should be able to build a deb by running :
 dpkg-buildpackage
from the main gmusicbrowser folder (it requires the debhelper package)

Any distribution
================
make install
