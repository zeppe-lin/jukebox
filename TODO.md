TODO jukebox
============


No milestone
------------

{{{

  - [ ] Get rid of `Gettext` artefacts.

  - [ ] Write new Makefile (current is broken).

  - [ ] Convert `layout_doc.mkd` into manual page.

  - [ ] Get more useful docs from gmusicbrowser.wiki.

  - [ ] Use system icons?
    The problem is that jukebox has a large number of icons that aren't covered
    by system icons.
