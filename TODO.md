TODO jukebox
============


No milestone
------------

  - [ ] FIXME: set vifm as inode/directory opener:
        `gio mime inode/directory vifm`
        Now, try to open the directory from jukebox using vifm:
        Right click on song, choose "Open containing folder".
        The trouble may hide in `sub run_system_cmd()`.

  - [ ] Use `gtk-leave-fullscreen` for fullscreen icon.

  - [ ] Get rid of `Gettext` artefacts.

  - [ ] Write new Makefile (current is broken).

  - [ ] Convert `layout_doc.mkd` into manual page.

  - [ ] Get more useful docs from gmusicbrowser.wiki.

  - [ ] Use system icons?
        The problem is that jukebox has a large number of icons that
        aren't covered by system icons.
