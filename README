Migration
---------

It's highly unrecommended since gmusicbrowser is fine and maintained
program with gtk3 support (unlike jukebox).  See gmusicbroser.org and
https://github.com/squentin/gmusicbrowser for more information.

Anyway...

1/2. Set library source:
sed -i 's@/mnt/data/oldmusic@/mnt/hd/actualmusic@g' jukeboxrc

2/2. Fix jukeboxrc fingerprint:
sed -i 's@gmbrc version=1.101502@jukeboxrc version=1.101503@g' jukeboxrc
