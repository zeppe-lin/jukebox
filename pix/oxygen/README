This is a mashup of Zeltak's Oxygen set for Gmusicbrowser, rounded out with some KDE Oxygen system icons to give the theme a little more of an "integrated" look when running on KDE4. Nothing in here is original work of mine, it's all either from Zeltak or the Oxygen team. I think it's complete, if you notice anything missing, please let me know.

INSTALLATION
*ACHTUNG!* These paths are valid in Ubuntu 8.04, if you're running something else check the paths first!
